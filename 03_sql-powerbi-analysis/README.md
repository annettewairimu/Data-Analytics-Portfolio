# Customer Service Analysis (SQL + Power BI)

## Business Problem
This project analyzes customer service data to monitor ticket volume, resolution performance, and operational efficiency.

## Data Sources
- Tickets
- Agents
- Updates
- Tags

## Workflow
SQL was used to extract and aggregate data, which was then loaded into Power BI for modeling and visualization.

## SQL Analysis
- Joined multiple tables to create analysis-ready datasets
- Aggregated ticket counts, resolution times, and SLA metrics
- Answered multiple business questions in a single structured SQL file

## Power BI Report
The Power BI report contains multiple report pages:
1. Executive overview
2. Operations deep dive
3. Customer insights (optional)

## Key Insights
- High-priority tickets take longer to resolve
- A small number of agents resolve most tickets
- Ticket volume varies significantly by day

## Recommendations
- Improve staffing during peak periods
- Review processes for urgent tickets
- Use historical trends for workload planning
