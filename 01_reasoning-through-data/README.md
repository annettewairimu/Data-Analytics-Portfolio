# Reasoning Through Data

## Objective
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how I approach data problems by framing questions, identifying relevant variables, and reasoning through data before performing any formal analysis.

## Datasets
- Job listings dataset (self-collected)
- House listings dataset (self-collected)

## Key Questions Considered
- What factors are likely to influence salary or rent price?
- Which variables may act as confounders?
- What assumptions need to be validated before analysis?

## Analytical Reasoning
- Identified core outcome variables (price, salary)
- Evaluated the relevance of location, experience, job type, and property features
- Considered missing values and potential bias in the data collection process

## Key Takeaways
- Understanding data structure is critical before analysis
- Poorly framed questions lead to misleading insights
- Simple reasoning can prevent incorrect conclusions
