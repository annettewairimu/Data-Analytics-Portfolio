# Project 1: Reasoning with Data. Freelance Jobs & Housing Market Analysis
## Project Overview

This project demonstrates reasoning with real-world, semi-structured datasets using Microsoft Excel.
It analyzes freelance job listings and housing listings, focusing on skill demand, pay patterns, property pricing, and market trends.

The emphasis is on analytical thinking, reasoning, pattern recognition, and actionable insights.

## Datasets
Dataset	Observations	Key Columns	Focus
### - Freelance Jobs	101 listings	
Location, Experience, Project Type, Required Skills, Platform, Job Title, Bids, Clients' Stated Budget, Avg Bid Amount, Currency, Bid Type (hourly/fixed)

### - Housing Listings 282 listings 
Estate, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Price, Kind/Features, Rent/Sale

Both datasets required cleaning, transformation, and derived metrics before analysis.

## Analytical Questions
### Freelance Jobs

Which skills are most frequently requested in freelance data analyst roles?

Which skill combinations attract higher pay?

How does experience level influence skill requirements and budgets?

Are high-paying, skill-heavy jobs more competitive?

### Housing Listings

How does housing price vary by number of bedrooms (sale and rent)?

How do prices compare across estates for similar house types?

Do additional features increase housing prices?

Which bedroom configurations are most commonly available?

Which estates or features offer better value-for-money?

## Analyses Performed

Standardized numeric fields (budgets, prices)

Parsed semi-structured text fields into analyzable categories (skills, features)

Created derived metrics:

Skill count and skill category flags (Excel, SQL, Power BI, BI tools, Programming)

Feature count and price-per-bedroom

Pivot tables and summary statistics for trend analysis:

Skills vs average pay

Skill count vs competition

Bedrooms vs price

Features vs price

Excel was used for data cleaning, transformation, and pivot-based analysis only.

## Key Insights
### Freelance Jobs
Insight	Description
Skill demand: Excel, SQL, and Power BI are the most frequently requested skills.
Skill breadth	Jobs requiring multiple analytical tools tend to offer higher pay.
Experience	Expert-level roles demand broader skill sets, commanding higher budgets.
Competition: High-paying, skill-heavy jobs attract more bids, indicating competition.
### Housing Listings
Insight	Description
Bedroom availability: One- and two-bedroom units dominate the rental market.
Price trends: Prices increase with bedroom count, but growth varies across estates.
Feature premium	Properties with more features tend to have higher prices.
Value-for-money	Certain estates offer a good balance of price, bedrooms, and features.

These insights demonstrate reasoning with data rather than reporting raw numbers.
