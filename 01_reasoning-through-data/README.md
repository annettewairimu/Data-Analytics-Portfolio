# Project 1: Reasoning with Data

## Freelance Jobs & Housing Market Analysis

## Overview

This project demonstrates analytical reasoning using real-world datasets in Microsoft Excel. It explores:

Freelance jobs: skill demand across experience levels

Housing market: property pricing trends, feature impact, and market patterns

The goal: derive actionable insights from semi-structured data through cleaning, transformation, and analysis.

### Datasets
**Freelance Jobs**

Listings: 41

Key columns: Experience Level, Project Type, Required Skills

**Housing Listings**

Listings: 282

Key columns: Estate, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Price, Features, Listing Type (Rent/Sale)

Both datasets required cleaning, transformation, and creation of derived metrics before analysis.

### Analytical Questions
**Freelance Jobs**

How is Excel demanded across experience levels?

How does experience influence skill requirements?

Are expert-level jobs more skill-heavy?

**Housing Listings**

How does the price change with bedrooms?

How do prices vary across estates for similar units?

Do additional features increase price?

What bedroom configurations dominate the market?

### Analyses Performed
**Job Listings**

Parsed text fields into skill categories: Excel, BI/Visualization, Programming, Statistics/Data Analysis, Database, Domain Knowledge

Created derived metrics: skill counts, skill flags

Analysis examples:

Jobs requiring Excel by experience level

Skill sets demanded at entry, intermediate, and expert levels

**Housing Listings**

Created derived features (feature counts)

Analyzed:

Bedrooms vs. Price

Features vs. Price

Feature Count vs. Price per Bedroom

Listing counts by category

### Key Insights
**Job Listings.**

**Overall Insight:**

Entry: Excel-focused, minimal visualization/programming/domain exposure

Intermediate: Excel + Visualization/BI + some Programming + Database + Domain knowledge

Expert: Excel + Visualization + Programming + Statistics + Domain knowledge

**Housing Listings**

Bedrooms & Price: Prices rise with the number of bedrooms; ownership sees sharper price increases than rent.

Estate Patterns:

Kitisuru: strong rental yields for 1–3 bedrooms

Kilimani: highest capital values, strong rental for studios & 5-bedroom units

Hurlingham/Kileleshwa: perform well for 4–5 bedrooms

Lavington: high sale prices, limited small-unit rentals

Features & Pricing: More features → higher price, especially for larger units

Bedroom Distribution: Mid-sized units (2–3 bedrooms) dominate; studios and 5-bedroom units are rare

**Insight:**

Price and features strongly influence value; mid-sized units form the market core.

## Tools Used

Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning, transformation, text parsing, formulas, and analysis

## Key Takeaways

Excel proficiency is almost universal for freelance roles at all experience levels.

Intermediate/expert jobs require a mix of BI, programming, statistics, and domain knowledge.

Housing prices correlate with the number of bedrooms, features, and estate location.
